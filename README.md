# NLP Food Recommender

This repository contains files related to an analysis for an NLP project. I’ve always wanted to learn how to cook healthier fancy meals but I never seem to have the time to cook a real meal because I am too busy or too lazy to do the research. So I decided to use this project as an opportunity to stop asking ”whats for dinner” and start cooking. 

For this project, I was able to identify the 3 most discuss topics from the recipes via NMF topic modeling. These topics gave me an idea for what were the most common ingredients that the typical home cook likes to make. I also created a content based recommendation system that generated recipe recommendations based on my specified dietary requirements.
